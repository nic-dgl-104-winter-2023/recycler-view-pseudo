# RecyclerView Pseudocode
This repository contains pseudocode and brief rationale for a design model based on Android RecyclerView. The intention is to use RecyclerView and infinite scrolling lists used in many mobile apps to demonstrate some of the design considerations and constraints inherent to mobile devices and development platforms. 

It is worth noting that more modern UI frameworks in Android (and elsewhere) have continued to obfuscate the details of how this (and related) patterns work, favouring instead a more literal style of UI development. 

## RecyclerView in Android
[Read this document](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/layout/recyclerview) to learn more about the Android-specific notions of recycled views and how a developer would implement a RecyclerView.

Check out the [RecyclerView API](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/recyclerview/widget/RecyclerView) if you'd like to learn more about how RecyclerView works under the hood, and how it relates to other APIs on the Android platform.
